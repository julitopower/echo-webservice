Echo WebService:
================
A very simple web service that accepts the following requests

GET /echo/<text to be escaped> HTTP/1.1

and returns json with the text escaped:

OK 200
{"escaped":"<escaped text>}


Why:
===

I am trying to put together all the tools to build web services using Java and the Jersey framework:

* Maven
* Ant
* Jersey
* Automatic webservice explorer
* ...

Word of caution:
===============

It is early days!!
